# Project-CloudPlay

CloudPlay is an experimental project that allows iOS users to create group playlists with their own songs and listen to these songs simultaneously. Therefore, CloudPlay allows users to listen to music in a synced speaker fashion - great for parties and interactive music sharing. 

CloudPlay makes use of the iOS Multipeer Connectivity Framework. Users may connect over WiFi, adhoc WiFi, or Bluetooth. The strongest connection is automatically chosen.
